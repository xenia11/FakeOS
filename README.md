# FakeOS

This software development project involves creating a fake operating system (OS) using JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The goal of this project is to develop a web application that looks and feels like a real OS, but does not actually perform any OS-level functions.

Features

- A taskbar
- Icons for applications and files
- A menu bar or start menu
- A clock or system tray

Functionality

While fake OS will not actually perform any OS-level functions, I added some functionality to make it feel more realistic, such as:

- Opening and closing applications or windows
- Displaying the current time and date

Instructions

In order to ensure that the project is tested correctly, it is essential to adjust the responsiveness settings for the phone. To do this, you can follow these steps:

- Click on the link to open the project in your web browser.
- Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" from the menu that appears.
- In the developer tools panel that opens, look for the option to adjust the responsiveness settings.
- Set the responsiveness for the phone, or use the shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + M" to simulate a mobile device.
- Reload the page to see the changes take effect.

By following these steps, you should be able to properly test the project on a mobile device. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project documentation
