# FakeOS

This software development project involves creating a fake operating system (OS) using JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The goal of this project is to develop a web application that looks and feels like a real OS, but does not actually perform any OS-level functions.

Features


A taskbar
Icons for applications and files
A menu bar or start menu
A clock or system tray

Functionality


While fake OS will not actually perform any OS-level functions, I added some functionality to make it feel more realistic, such as:

Opening and closing applications or windows
Displaying the current time and date
